## Overview
This project is a digital version of the board game Onitama, a turn based strategy game similar to chess. Each player starts off with four pawns and a king, and there are 5 cards that rotate as the game continues. Our game includes a single player version (complete with a somewhat smart bot, by which I mean a not very smart bot), a two player version, and a tutorial. 
## Instructions
The tutorial will guide you through how to make a move as well as the mechanics of the game, but here is a quick version. To move, choose a move card and a piece (in any order). The valid places to moves should be highlighted in green. When you move, the card that you used will swap with the spare card. A player may win by either moving their king into the other player’s “temple,” the colored square on the opponent's side, or by capturing the other player’s king. On the upper left we also have three dots that will show a dropdown menu with two cheats. The first is labeled capture, and allows you to use Tiger to capture either the king or a pawn. The other one is labeled temple which allows you to use Tiger to move into the other player's temple.
